The prime intention of this guide is to provide you deployment scenarios from test to production and there by helping the businesses organization to adopt OpenStack as their primary IaaS platform. These scenarios have thoroughly tested by OpenStack Engineers at LK Domain Registry and proven to be working. You can use the documents here to learn, test, and finally deploy production ready OpenStack private/public/hybrid IaaS clouds for your business OK, Let's go with OpenStack !!!","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"configure-node-network/","text":"This section covers all the steps that are required for configuring the network interfaces,bonding, VLAN, and DNS of your nodes Switch Port Configuration # Note The following example provides a good reference for switch configuration and cabinet layout. This example may be more than what is required for basic setups however it can be adjusted to just about any configuration. Additionally you will need to adjust the VLANS noted within this example to match your environment.
